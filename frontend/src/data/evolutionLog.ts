    id: 'trust-tiers',
    date: '2026-01-29',
    title: 'Source Trust Tier System',
    problem: 'Every event required Claude validation, even from reliable sources like Meetup groups that consistently post valid AI events. This was costing ~$1.50/day in API calls.',
    action: 'Built a trust tier system: sources start on probation, earn trust through consistent quality (80%+ pass rate), and can be demoted for poor performance.',
    result: 'Trusted sources now skip validation. API costs reduced by ~50%. The agent learns which sources to trust.',
    category: 'optimization',
    commitHash: '570328f',
  },
  {
    id: 'image-location',
    date: '2026-01-14',
    title: 'Image-Based Location Extraction',
    problem: 'Some events had venue information only in their promotional images, not in the text. These events showed "Location: TBD" even when the flyer clearly showed the address.',
    action: 'Added image analysis capability - when an event is missing venue data, the agent now analyzes the event image using Claude\'s vision.',
    result: 'Events with image-only venue info now display correct locations. Filled gaps that text scraping missed.',
    category: 'capability',
    commitHash: '6346226',

  {
    id: 'html-entities',
    date: '2026-01-14',
    title: 'HTML Entity Decoding',
    problem: 'Event titles and descriptions contained raw HTML entities like "&amp;" instead of "&" and "&apos;" instead of apostrophes. Text looked garbled.',
    action: 'Added HTML entity decoding to all scrapers using the he library.',
    result: 'All text now displays cleanly without encoding artifacts.',

    id: 'sonnet-upgrade',
    date: '2026-01-07',
    title: 'Claude Model Upgrade',
    problem: 'The agent was using an older Claude model. Newer models offer better accuracy and efficiency.',
    action: 'Upgraded to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all validation, classification, and analysis tasks.',
    result: 'Improved accuracy in event validation and classification while maintaining cost efficiency.',

    id: 'end-times',
    date: '2026-01-07',
    title: 'End Time Extraction',
    problem: 'Events from web search and Austin AI sources were missing end times. Calendar showed events starting but not when they ended.',
    action: 'Updated websearch.js and austinai.js scrapers to properly extract end times from event data.',
    result: 'Events now display complete time ranges (e.g., "6:00 PM - 8:00 PM" instead of just "6:00 PM").',

    id: 'timezone-fix',
    date: '2026-01-07',
    title: 'Austin Timezone Handling',
    problem: 'Events were showing at wrong times. A 7pm meetup would display as 1am or 1pm due to timezone confusion between UTC and local time.',
    action: 'Audited timezone handling across all scrapers. Applied America/Chicago timezone correctly when sources return local times without timezone info.',
    result: 'All event times now display correctly in Austin local time.',

  {
    id: 'year-awareness',
    date: '2026-01-05',
    title: 'Dynamic Date Awareness',
    problem: 'Some prompts and scrapers had hardcoded years (e.g., "2025"). As time passed, the agent would reject valid future events or misdate them.',
    action: 'Replaced all hardcoded years with dynamic date generation. The agent now always knows the current date.',
    result: 'Events are correctly dated regardless of when the agent runs. No more year-related bugs.',

  {
    id: 'single-event-filter',
    date: '2026-01-05',
    title: 'Single Event URL Filtering',
    problem: 'Source discovery was adding individual event URLs (e.g., meetup.com/event/123) instead of event listing pages (e.g., meetup.com/austin-ai/events). This polluted the source list.',
    action: 'Added URL pattern detection to reject single-event URLs and only accept event listing/calendar pages.',
    result: 'Source list stays clean with reusable event listing pages that yield multiple events per scrape.',

    id: 'feedback-analysis',
    date: '2026-01-04',
    title: 'Feedback Analysis System',
    problem: 'When users reported events the agent missed, there was no systematic way to learn from this feedback and improve discovery.',
    action: 'Built a feedback analysis system that processes missed event reports, generates new search queries, and identifies potential new sources.',
    result: 'The agent can now learn from user feedback and expand its discovery reach based on what it missed.',

    id: 'validation-improvements',
    date: '2026-01-03',
    title: 'Validation Accuracy Improvements',
    problem: 'Event validation had false positives (non-events getting through) and false negatives (valid events being rejected). Organizer and location extraction was inconsistent.',
    action: 'Refined validation prompts, improved organizer extraction logic, and enhanced location parsing.',
    result: 'More accurate event validation with better metadata extraction. Fewer manual corrections needed.',

    id: 'run-logging',
    date: '2026-01-03',
    title: 'Agent Run Logging',
    problem: 'No visibility into what the agent was doing. Couldn\'t tell if it ran successfully, how many events it found, or if there were errors.',
    action: 'Created agent_runs table to log every run with detailed stats: events found, sources scraped, API calls made, errors encountered.',
    result: 'Full visibility into agent performance. Enables the Observatory dashboard and debugging.',

    id: 'query-prioritization',
    date: '2026-01-03',
    title: 'Smart Query Prioritization',
    problem: 'Search queries were run in arbitrary order. Queries that never found anything were run as often as productive ones. No exploration of new queries.',
    action: 'Implemented priority scoring with time decay. Productive queries get boosted, stale queries deprioritized. Added exploration budget for trying new queries.',
    result: 'More efficient use of limited SerpAPI quota. Better balance between exploitation and exploration.',

    id: 'timezone-dedup',
    date: '2025-12-31',
    title: 'Timezone-Aware Deduplication',
    problem: 'The same event posted on different platforms with slight timezone representation differences was being treated as two separate events.',
    action: 'Enhanced duplicate detection to normalize timezones before comparison.',
    result: 'Cross-platform duplicates are now correctly identified and merged.',

  {
    id: 'event-summaries',
    date: '2025-12-31',
    title: 'AI-Generated Summaries',
    problem: 'Event descriptions varied wildly in length and quality. Some were walls of text, others too brief. Hard to quickly understand what an event was about.',
    action: 'Added Claude-powered summary generation for each event. Also added detection for paid vs free events.',
    result: 'Every event now has a concise, consistent summary. Users can quickly scan and understand events.',

    date: '2025-12-31',
    title: 'Cross-Platform Duplicate Detection',
    problem: 'Organizers often post the same event on Meetup, Lu.ma, and Eventbrite. The calendar was showing duplicates.',
    action: 'Improved fuzzy matching to detect same event across different platforms by comparing titles, times, and locations.',
    result: 'Duplicate events are merged. Users see each event once regardless of how many platforms list it.',

  {
    id: 'autonomous-discovery',
    date: '2025-12-31',
    title: 'Autonomous Source Discovery',
    problem: 'The agent could only scrape sources that were manually added. It couldn\'t find new event sources on its own.',
    action: 'Built web search integration with SerpAPI. The agent now searches for Austin AI events, analyzes results, extracts potential sources, and adds them to its rotation.',
    result: 'The agent continuously discovers new event sources without human intervention. This is the core learning loop.',

    title: 'Initial Scraper Suite',
    problem: 'Needed to gather AI events from multiple platforms, each with different page structures and data formats.',
    action: 'Built specialized scrapers for Meetup (GraphQL), Lu.ma (JSON-LD), Eventbrite, Austin Forum, AI Accelerator, Austin AI Alliance, Leaders in AI, and a generic HTML parser.',

    problem: 'Austin has a vibrant AI community, but events are scattered across multiple platforms. No single place to find them all.',
    action: 'Created Austin AI Events: a Next.js frontend with Supabase backend, and a Node.js agent that discovers, validates, and curates AI events.',
